Key Result Metrics
1. Achieved/Not Achieved
This binary metric tracks whether a key result or objective has been fully accomplished or not. It is
useful for clear-cut goals where partial progress is not as relevant.
Example: Objective: Obtain 2 International certifications by the end of the year.

• Key Result 1: Achieve ISO 9001 certification.
• Key Result 2: Achieve occupational safety and health certification.

Progress is either 0% or 100%, depending on whether the objective has been achieved.
If one certification is achieved:

• Key Result Progress = 100% If certification is achieved:
• Key Result Progress = 0% If not achieved

Then OKR Score = (0% + 100% / 2) = 50%

Although the key results in this example are all the same they might have different weights, you
can review milestone metrics to find key results that have different weights.


2. Milestone
Milestones can be weighted differently based on their importance or difficulty. Each milestone
contributes a specific percentage to the total progress.
Example: Objective: Launch PEP by the end of FY2017Q1.
Key Result 1: Finalize PEP Design(Weight 40). 80% progressed

• Milestone 1: Finalize Requirements (Weight: 30%). Done
• Milestone 2: Finalize Product Design (Weight: 50%). Done
• Milestone 2: Finalize Design Testing (Weight: 20%). Not Yet
Key Result 2: Finalize PEP Implementation (Weight 35). 75% progressed

• Milestone 1: Finalize Frontend Implementation (Weight: 25%). Done
• Milestone 2: Finalize Backend (Weight: 25%). Done
• Milestone 3: Finalize Integration (Weight: 25%). Done
• Milestone 4: Finalize Services Communication (Weight: 25%). Not Yet
Key Result 3: Finalize PEP Deployment and Launch (Weight 25) 40% progressed

• Milestone 1: Finalize PEP Deployment (Weight: 40%). Done
• Milestone 2: Conduct beta testing (Weight: 40%). Not Yet
• Milestone 4: Launch the product (Weight: 25%). Not Yet
Progress is calculated by summing the weights of the completed milestones.

• Key Result 1 Progress = 30% (Milestone 1) + 50% (Milestone 2) = 80% 32 26.25
• Key Result 2 Progress = 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%
• Key Result 3 Progress = 30% + 50% = 80%

Objective: Launch PEP by the end of FY2017Q1 score is

(KR1 Progress×KR1 Weight)+(KR2 Progress×KR2 Weight)+(KR3 Progress×KR3 Weight)
KR1 Weight + KR2 Weight + KR3 Weight
(80%×40)+(75%×35)+(40%×25)​
40+35+25
= 68.25%


3. Currency
Currency-based metrics measure financial targets, such as revenue, cost savings, or cash
collections. This metric helps in tracking monetary objectives from an initial value to a target
value.
Example:
Objective: Increase the company revenue.
Key Result 1: Increase sales revenue from $200,000 to $500,000 in Q1.

• Initial Revenue: $200,000
• Target Revenue: $500,000
• Actual Revenue: $350,000

Key Result 2: Achieve project cash collection of $1,000,000 in Q1.

• Initial Cash Collection: $0
• Target Cash Collection: $1,000,000
• Actual Cash Collection: $600,000

Progress is calculated by the amount of revenue or cash collection above the initial value divided
by the target increase.

• Key Result 1 Progress is
• ((Actual Award - Initial Award) / (Target Award - Initial Award)) 100%
• (($350,000 - $200,000) / ($500,000 - $200,000))100%= 50%
• Key Result 2 Progress is
• ((Actual Cash Collection - Initial Cash Collection) / (Target Cash Collection - Initial Cash
Collection)) 100%

• (($600,000 - 0) / ($1,000,000 - $0)) 100%= 60%

OKR Score of Increase the company revenue objective is
50%+60%/2 = 55%
Although the key results in this example are all the same they might have different weights, you
can review milestone metrics to find key results that have different weights.


4. Numeri

Numeric metrics measure objectives using specific numbers that are not monetary. This could
include, number of new clients, number of employees, or website visits.
Example: Objective: Increase the number of new client acquisitions.

• Key Result: Increase client acquisitions from 20 to 50 in Q1.

Progress is calculated by the number of new clients acquired above the initial value divided by the
target increase.
If 35 new clients are acquired in Q2:

• Initial Clients = 20
• Target Clients = 50
• Actual Clients = 35
• Progress = ((35 - 20) / (50 - 20)) 100% = (15 / 30) 100% = 50%

Although the key results in this example are all the same they might have different weights, you
can review milestone metrics to find key results that have different weights.


5. Percentage
Percentage metrics measure progress or completion of an objective in percentage terms. It is
often used for ongoing tasks or goals where incremental progress is measurable.
Example: Objective: Improve customer satisfaction.

• Key Result: Increase customer satisfaction score from 75% to 90%.

Progress is calculated by the increase achieved above the initial value divided by the target
increase.
If customer satisfaction improves to 85%:

• Initial Satisfaction = 75%
• Target Satisfaction = 90%
• Actual Satisfaction = 85%
• Progress = ((85% - 75%) / (90% - 75%)) 100% = (10% / 15%) 100% = 66.67%

Although the key results in this example are all the same they might have different weights, you
can review milestone metrics to find key results that have different weights.


6 KPI (Increase / Decrease)
This metric tracks the frequency of occurrences or events within a specific period. It is useful for
measuring efficiency, utilization, or time-based metrics.
Example: Objective: Improve Customer Support Efficiency by the end of the quarter.


• Key Result 1: Increase the number of support tickets resolved per hour from 10 to 15.
• Initial Value: 10 tickets/hour
• Target Value: 15 tickets/hour
• Actual Value: 13 tickets/hour
• Key Result 2: Decrease the average resolution time per ticket from 4 hours to 2 hours.
• Initial Value: 4 hours/ticket
• Target Value: 2 hours/ticket
• Actual Value: 3 hours/ticket
• Key Result 3: Increase the number of proactive support calls made per week from 50 to 100.
• Initial Value: 50 calls/week
• Target Value: 100 calls/week
• Actual Value: 80 calls/week

Progress Calculation:

Key Result 1 Progress:

• (Actual Value − Initial Value / Target Value - Initial Value) * 100%
=(13 -10 / 15 - 10) * 100%
=60%
Key Result 2 Progress:

• (Initial Value − Actual Value / Initial Value−Target Value) * 100%
=(4 -3 / 4 - 2) * 100%
=50%
Key Result 3 Progress:

• (Actual Value − Initial Value / Target Value - Initial Value) * 100%
=(80 -50 / 100 - 50) * 100%
=50%
Although the key results in this example are all the same they might have different weights, you
can review milestone metrics to find key results that have different weights.

metrics.


OKR Score Calculation
Individual OKR Score:
Individual OKR = (KR1 weight × KR1 progress / 100) + (KR2 weight × KR2 progress / 100)

Each key result (KR) contributes to the overall score based on its assigned weight and progress
percentage.
Lead OKR Score:
The lead’s OKR score is calculated by combining their individual OKR contribution and their team's
average OKR progress. The formula is:
Lead OKR = (Individual OKR contribution Weight × Individual OKR progress / 100) + (Team OKR
contribution Weight × Team average OKR progress / 100)
