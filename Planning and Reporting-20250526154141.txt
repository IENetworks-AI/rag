Planning and Reporting
1. Introduction
Planning and Reporting sub-module is designed to facilitate effective planning and reporting of objectives and key results (OKRs) within specified time periods. It empowers users to create, submit, and align plans and reports across daily, weekly, and monthly intervals while ensuring accountability and transparency. The system supports milestone tracking, automatic reprimands for missed submissions, and collaborative features such as commenting, validation, and unlocking of plans by users with appropriate roles.


2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Description
The Planning and Reporting sub-module enables system Users to:
* Define and configure planning/reporting periods (daily, weekly, monthly).
* Enable users to create plans and reports for specified periods.
* Allow users to create milestones as tasks for tracking progress on key objectives.
* Permit users to edit plans/reports until they are approved by their direct managers.
* Provide managers the ability to validate submitted plans/reports.
* Specify deadlines for plan/report submission.
* Set predefined rules for triggering automatic appreciation and reprimands.
