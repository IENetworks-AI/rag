1. Introduction 
- At IE, strict planning and reporting are cultural standards that make us different from other companies. IE employs a controlled, measurable, consistent and open communication platform that is in line with performance management system that it built to boost the engagement and productivity of employees.


2. CLASSIFICATION OF ROLES 
2.1. Teams 
Teams are the foundational work units within the company, composed of employees who collaborate on specific projects, tasks, or functions. Each team is led by a Team Lead, who follows up on staff's plan and report, monitors performance, and ensures alignment with company objectives. Teams work closely within their respective divisions to execute operational and strategic priorities.
2.2. Departments
Departments are specialized functional units within the company that focus on specific areas such as Sales, Finance, Marketing, etc... Each department is composed of multiple teams that collaborate to achieve departmental objectives and are led by managers. Departments ensure company-wide strategies are effectively implemented within their focus areas, led by managers. 
2.3. Divisions  
Divisions are high-level organizational units responsible for overseeing multiple teams and ensuring alignment with strategic goals. Each division is led by a Division Chief or Manager, who ensures that teams within the division collaborate effectively, meet their objectives, and escalate critical issues to the Executive level when necessary. 
2.4. Executives 
The Executive level consists of the CEO, Chiefs, and key executives responsible for strategic decision-making and overall company direction. They address high-level concerns escalated from divisions, set company-wide priorities, and ensure that all departments work towards the company's long-term vision and goals.


3. Planning framework of IE
- OKR is a planning framework that stands for "objective and key result".
- OKRs is a collaborative goal-setting methodology used by teams and individuals to set challenging, ambitious goals with measurable results. In IE, we plan 4 OKRs annually by dividing them into quarters and scoring them by the end of every three month.
- All division in IE plan their OKR on week 13 of every quarter and after getting approval from their direct manager and the planning and performance management team proceeds to inserting the plan into system.

A. Objective: 
- It's the general form of our goal and it and shows "WHAT" needs to be accomplished.
- An individual can only plan 3-6 objectives in an OKR. This is to avoid being over ambitious and failing on certain goals.
B. Key Result:
- It is the specific and measurable form of our objective and the paths we walk to achieve the general goal we have and it shows the "HOW" of our overall objective.
- An individual can only plan 2-6 key results in number for a single objective. This is to make the process of achieving that certain objective more precise.
3.1. OKR Metrics
- In IE, we use OKR metrics to be able to measure our key results and ensure they are planned in a specific and measurable standard. Some of our metrics are; 

* Numeric: This metrics indicates key result that is measured by counting.
* Achieve: indicates key result that is measured by delivery and approval of document and a task that doesn't have milestone.
* Percentage: indicates key result that is measured by the set percentage level of increasing a target or decreasing an unsatisfactory event.
* Currency: indicates key result that is measured by achieving the set value.
* Milestone: indicates key results that have major sub tasks inside them.
3.2. OKR weight
- OKR weight is used to differentiate the value of our targets and give higher weight to key results that have high impact on the company goals and objectives. In addition, the total amount of key result in one objective must be 100 in total.
3.3. OKR Scoring
- When we approach the end of an OKR cycle, which is on the week 13 (Friday) of every quarter we've reached the perfect time for scoring OKRs. Scoring OKRs provides an opportunity for you and your team to reflect on accomplishments and evaluate what should be done differently during the next cycle. 
OKR Achievement scale in IE;
- Score 75 and above - Good performance appreciation letter
- Score between 60 and 75 - Average performance reminder letter
- Score between 60 and 50 - Poor performance warning letter
- Score below 50 - Final performance warning letter


4. Overall introduction to planning and reporting
- All plans and report are reviewed and followed up by the planning and performance management team on a daily. The team responds to a check in "Who didn't close any one of his/her subordinates' daily check-in before 6:30AM or weekly check-in on Saturday before 10:00PM? Who has not properly planned their Weekly, Daily plans" to ensure the planning process is consistently being enforced by all employees.
